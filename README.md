# EmptyWPFwithScroll
Every time i started a new project i needed to do this for the frame in windows. Finally here it is - my copy&paste template for a new WPF-project with a 'Display' as console output.  
With Java i did happen to use the Apache Server and he closed everything even the console output. So i started to have such outputs in my Java FXML programs.  
As i am fond of C# and only use this anymore i dearly needed that for C#.  


Make it to a project template under 'Project -> export template'. There you take the whole project and add a few words for your convenience. Visual Studio will add it to your local templates and you can start to use it.
